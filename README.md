# Python-SQL_Energy_Forecast
To forecast energy consumption using SQL and Python
Data Collection: Gather historical energy consumption data (e.g., hourly, daily, or monthly consumption).

SQL Database: Store the historical data in a SQL database for querying.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data (e.g., handling missing values, converting date/time).

Modeling: Use time series forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or machine learning models like Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.

Forecasting: Use the trained model to predict future energy consumption.
